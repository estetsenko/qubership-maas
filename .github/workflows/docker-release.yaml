# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to be triggered when a release is marked as a full release.
# The workflow performs the following tasks:
# 1. Checks if the tag already exists.
# 2. Tags the commit with the release version.
# 3. Builds and publishes a Docker image.
# 4. Creates a GitHub release.

# To make it work for your project, you need to adjust the pom.xml and add configuration file for GitHub release.
# Please find detailed instructions:
# https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-workflow-hub?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-project-release-workflow
